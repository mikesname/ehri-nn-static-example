            <h1>About EHRI-UK</h1>

            <p class="intro">
                The <a href="https://www.ehri-project.eu">European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)</a> is an international infrastructure
                securing Holocaust research, commemoration and education on a trans-national level.
                EHRI-UK is the national node representing the United Kingdom within this international
                research consortium.
            </p>

            <h3>EHRI-UK will seek to ensure the long-term sustainability of Holocaust research within the UK and beyond by:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>representing institutions within the UK (and Crown Dependencies) which contain materials related to Holocaust
                    Studies to create a strong research consortium;</li>
                <li>connecting resources through a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure;</li>
                <li>developing innovative digital research tools;</li>
                <li>offering fellowships and training opportunities for researchers, archivists, and heritage professionals.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                EHRI's impact is primarily scientific, however, the infrastructure also advances a wider
                social and political agenda. The recent rise of antisemitism, xenophobia and aggressive
                nationalisms in Europe and beyond demonstrate that Holocaust research is never a purely
                academic concern, but a prerequisite for open and non-discriminatory societies across
                Europe and beyond.
