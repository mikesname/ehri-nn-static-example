                            The Wiener Holocaust Library is one of the world's leading and most extensive archives on the Holocaust and Nazi era.
                            Formed in 1933, the Library's unique collection of over one million items includes published and unpublished works, press cuttings, photographs and eyewitness testimony.
                            The Library provides a resource to oppose anti-Semitism and other forms of prejudice and intolerance.
                            </p>
                        <p>
                            The library exists to serve scholars, professional researchers, the media and the public as a library of record and is a living memorial to the evils of the past,
                            ensuring that its wealth of materials is put at the service of the future. The Wiener Holocaust Library aims to engage people of all ages and backgrounds in
                            understanding the Holocaust and its historical context through an active educational programme and by communicating the accessibility, power and contemporary
                            relevance of its collections as a national resource for those wishing to prevent possible future genocides.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Wiener Holocaust Library is involved in governance and legal work, finance, sustainability and research and innovation strategy.
